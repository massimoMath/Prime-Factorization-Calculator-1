# Prime Factorization Calculator
*This calculator allows you to calculate prime factor decomposition of a positive integer and detects if the number is prime. </br> For detailed calculations, performance tools and advanced features open web console (f12)*.

## Web Interface

**The calculator provides results in two different ways** *(for the second option you have to open console)* **:** 
- **Default:** only the divisors are showed.</br>
  **`n`<sup>`a`</sup>** </br>
  
  **`n`<sup>`a`</sup>** </br>
   
  **`n`<sup>`a`</sup>** ... </br>
  
- **Advanced:** All calculations are showed. The first number in each `Calculation()` is the result of the division of the two numbers in the previous calculation *(for example here: `c` = `a` &#247; `b` and `e` = `c` &#247; `d`).*

  **`Calculation (1):`** </br>
  **`a` &#247; `b`** </br>
  
  **`Calculation (2):`** </br>
  **`c` &#247; `d`** </br>
  
  **`Calculation (3):`** </br>
  **`e` &#247; `f`** ... </br> 
  
  **You can also access all the numbers you previously prime factorized by clicking on *Browse your history* (based on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"> local storage</a>)** </br>
